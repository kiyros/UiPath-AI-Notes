RPA stands for Robotic process automation



### What is Digital Transformation
- Digital transformation is directly influenced by the people adopting it, not technology.
- New skills, new roles, a culture of openness to change, and permanent external exploration make digital transformation more than a strategic and technological project.

- Digital transformation can be anything from IT infrastructure modernization to optimization or new digital business models.
- **Advanced analytics** help you measure automation performance against business KPIs (like time or money saved).
- **Long-running workflows** enable you to orchestrate complex automated processes. It facilitates synchronous and asynchronous interactions between human users and robots for maximum effectiveness and resource allocation.
- **Process Mining** **and Task Mining** allow you to scientifically discover automation use cases in the organization by analyzing back-end and front-end data.

-   **Automation is industry agnostic** - no matter how you look at it, there are automation use-cases in any business.
-   **Automation doesn't just impact revenue and time** - automating repetitive tasks also leads to an improved customer and employee experience, eases the AI operations, ensures compliance, and makes the decision-making process faster.
